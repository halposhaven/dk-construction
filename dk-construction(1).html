            <p>Ever sketch your dream home on a napkin with the unshakeable certainty of someone who's never actually built anything? Do you find yourself nodding along to HGTV while thinking "I could totally do that" despite all available evidence to the contrary? Are you exhausted by contractors who insist on bringing their so-called "expertise" and "decades of experience" into every conversation? Welcome to D-K Construction, where we've never encountered a project we didn't think we could handle, mainly because we've never encountered most projects.</p>

We specialize in bringing your Pinterest board to life without the burden of regulatory compliance slowing down your vision. After all, those codes are updated every three years, which really suggests they're more like guidelines that keep changing their mind, doesn't it?</p>

Instructions optional, permits negotiable, results guaranteed to be... results.</p>

Our renovation philosophy is simple: why consult blueprints when you have ambition? Previous homeowners left those walls there for a reason, but they clearly didn't have your vision.</p>

We have absolutely no data suggesting these are bad ideas. Our design process is revolutionary: we listen to what you want, nod confidently, and then try to build exactly that without the burden of excessive contemplation.</p>

Sure, we've never actually worked on a historical building before, but how different can it be? Old things are basically just new things that have been around longer.</p>

                    <p>Founded on the revolutionary principle that not knowing is just another form of knowing, D-K Construction has been confidently transforming the construction industry since last Tuesday. We believe that decades of accumulated building knowledge, engineering principles, and safety regulations are really just one perspective.</p>
                    <p>Our team brings a fresh approach to construction—so fresh, in fact, that we haven't been influenced by conventional wisdom, building codes, or physics. We're not constrained by what's "possible" or "structurally sound" because we simply haven't learned those limitations yet.</p>
                    <p>Why hire architects when you have conviction? Why consult engineers when you have can-do spirit? At D-K Construction, we've discovered that the less we know, the more we're willing to try. It's technically a strategy.</p>
